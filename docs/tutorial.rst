Introduction
============

This tutorial shows how to use the qmt toolbox to quickly process inertial sensor data with various algorithms.

To use qmt, simply import the ``qmt`` package::

    import qmt

In a Jupyter notebook, you can use the following template to also get access to the most important packages and
configure numpy printing options::

    %pylab --no-import-all notebook
    import qmt, os, sys, time, re, glob, itertools, math, collections
    from pathlib import Path
    np.set_printoptions(suppress=True)

.. _tutorial_py_quaternion_functions:

Basic quaternion functions
==========================

Most motion tracking applications will deal with time series of quaternion data. Most functions assume that a quaternion
time series of N samples will be stored in an (N, 4) numpy array.

The qmt toolbox includes many functions for the most common quaternion operations (e.g., quaternion multiplication
:meth:`qmt.qmult`, inverting :meth:`qmt.qinv`, calculating relative quaternions :meth:`qmt.qrel`) and also for the
conversion to and from other representation (e.g., :meth:`qmt.eulerAngles`, :meth:`qmt.quatFromAngleAxis`) and much
more. See :ref:`python_functions` for a list of all functions.

Here is a simple example that shows how 100 random quaternions are generated, then multiplied with a fixed 90Â° rotation,
and then converted to Euler angles::

    q1 = qmt.randomQuat(100)  # returns a (100, 4) array
    q2 = qmt.quatFromAngleAxis(np.deg2rad(90), [1, 0, 0])  # returns a (4,) array
    q3 = qmt.qmult(q1, q2)  # returns a (100, 4) array
    angles = np.rad2deg(qmt.eulerAngles(q3, 'zxy', intrinsic=True))  # return a (100, 3) array

Debug outputs and debug plots
=============================

All data processing functions have an optional ``debug`` argument that is set to ``False`` by default. If set to
``True``, the function will either return an extra debug output or set the ``debug`` key in the ``outputs`` dictionary.
This debug output is a dictionary containing various signals that help understanding how the function works internally.

Furthermore, every data processing function has an optional ``plot`` argument that is set to ``False`` by default. If
set to ``True``, a debug plot will automatically be created. You can use the function :func:`qmt.setupDebugPlots`
to configure how debug plots should behave, e.g. save them to files (or a multipage PDF!) or control the size of the
figures.

.. plot::
   :include-source:

    t = qmt.timeVec(T=10, Ts=0.01)
    axis = np.column_stack([np.cos(t), np.zeros_like(t), np.sin(t)])
    quat = qmt.quatFromAngleAxis(np.sin(t), axis, debug=True, plot=True)

.. _tutorial_py_webapps:

Webapps for 3D visualization
============================

The qmt toolbox comes with a versatile system for creating web-based visualizations. The main goal of this system is
to make it as easy to visualize complex kinematic chains in 3D as it is to create a line plot. For this, qmt comes with
flexible apps that can display arbitrary kinematic chains as box models.

When used in Python scripts, an extra window will pop up to show the webapp. In Jupyter notebooks, the webapps can be
embedded directly into the notebook.

This framework can also be used to build complex applications that read data from IMUs in realtime, process the data,
create 3D visualizations and provide various controls for interaction. But for the simple case, only two lines of code
are needed to open a 3D visualization::

    # generate example data
    t = qmt.timeVec(T=10, Ts=0.01)
    axis = np.column_stack([np.cos(t), np.zeros_like(t), np.sin(t)])
    quat = qmt.quatFromAngleAxis(np.sin(t), axis)
    data = qmt.Struct(t=t, quat=quat)

    # run webapp
    webapp = qmt.Webapp('/view/imubox', data=data)
    webapp.run()

There is a number of simple examples showing how to use the :class:`qmt.Webapp` class for different use cases.
Please take a look at the files ``webapp_example_script.py`` and ``webapp_example_notebook.ipynb``  in the
`examples/ <https://github.com/dlaidig/qmt/tree/main/examples>`__ folder.

See :ref:`ref_webapps` for a list of all available webapps and :ref:`dev_webapps` for some information on how to create
custom webapps.

For playback of stored data from .mat or .json files, there is a command-line utility called ``qmt-webapp``. Run
``qmt-webapp -h`` to see how to use it.

.. _tutorial_py_matlab_interface:

Matlab interface
================

Using `Transplant <https://github.com/bastibe/transplant>`_, it is possible to call Matlab functions from Python
scripts using the ``qmt.matlab`` prefix. For example, ``qmt.matlab.qmult`` will call the Matlab function
:mat:func:`+qmt.qmult`.

This will start an instance of Matlab in the background the first time a Matlab function is called. If the path does not
contain an executable with the name ``matlab``, you will need to initialize Matlab manually before the first usage::

    qmt.matlab.init(executable='/usr/local/MATLAB/R2017b/bin/matlab')

``qmt.matlab`` provides access to functions in the ``+qmt`` Matlab package. It is possible to get access to the
full Matlab instance and execute arbitrary code in Matlab::

    m = qmt.matlab.instance
    print('matlab version:', m.version())


.. note:: Transplant will convert Python dictionaries to ``containers.Map`` by default. To pass arguments as a Matlab
    ``struct``, use a :class:`qmt.Struct`.
